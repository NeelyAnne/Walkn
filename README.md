Walkn provides you witha map of some of Atlanta's hottest spots for pets and their owners to socialize, grab a bite, or just hang out.

you can save them for future reference. Learn all the best pet-friendly place in ATL and start adding to your collection now!

## **Technology:**

- NodeJS with ExpressJS server
- Express-Session to build our authentication around
- Bcrypt for hashing
- Database
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- React.js
- Axios-node module

## **Our database consists of 2 models/collections:**

- Users
- Locations

## **Challenges:**

Working through building out the authentication with forms, database, and local storage components was an experience that helped to layout the full Reactjs system in an easy and understandable way. A lot was learned in the process of writing most of our own authentication and verication methods with noteable exceptions of Bcrypt and Express-sessions instead of predesigned websites like IceBox. Additionally we hadn't considered the ephemeral storage of Heroku as being a major problem to solve as we weren't actually aware of the situation initially especially with the presence of two running servers from both MongoDB and Node.js.
