Challenges

Working through building out the authentication with forms, database, and local storage components was an experience that helped to layout the full Reactjs system in an easy and understandable way. A lot was learned in the process of writing most of our own authentication and verication methods with noteable exceptions of Bcrypt and Express-sessions instead of predesigned websites like IceBox. Additionally we hadn't considered the ephemeral storage of Heroku as being a major problem to solve as we weren't actually aware of the situation initially especially with the presence of two running servers from both MongoDB and Node.js.
